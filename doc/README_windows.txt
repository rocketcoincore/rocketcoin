Rocketcoin Core
=============

Intro
-----
Rocketcoin is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone with or without payment receiver verification, anywhere in the world. 
Rocketcoin plans to use a send and verify technology to ensure that no payment
is lost if sent to an incorrect, improper, or malformed address.  The concept 
with Rocketcoin is to allow users the ability to send a payment but set a time 
limit that the payment must be accepted or the payment is returned to the sender 
and the funds are not lost. The concept is to prevent coins and funds from being 
lost due to a incorrect address or incorrect coin type.  Rocketcoin uses peer-to
-peer technology to operate with no central authority: managing transactions and 
issuing money are carried out collectively by the network. Rocketcoin Core is the 
name of open source software which enables the use of this currency.  Rocketcoin 
Verify is the technology enablement platform that allows for transaction 
confirmation and verification.


Setup
-----
Unpack the files into a directory and run rocketcoin-qt.exe.

Rocketcoin Core is the original Rocketcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network.
However, it downloads and stores the entire history of Rocketcoin transactions;
depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization
process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.
